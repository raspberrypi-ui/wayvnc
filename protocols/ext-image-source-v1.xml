  <description summary="opaque image source objects">
    This protocol serves as an intermediary between screen capturing protocols
    and potential image sources such as outputs and toplevels.

    This protocol may be extended to support more image sources in the future,
    thereby adding those image sources to other protocols that use the image
    source object without having to modify those protocols.

      A manager for creating image source objects for standard objects. Sources
